Where to Look for Help
======================

Please follow the instructions at https://poedit.net/support when asking for support. 

The GitHub issue tracker is intended for reporting and managing *bugs* (i.e. something is wrong with Poedit),
not for e.g. asking questions — use help@poedit.net for the latter.

If you create an issue or need to ask about a problem, try to follow this checklist:

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of Poedit; update it if not. Chances are this will fix the problem.
1. Have a look at *Help → GNU gettext manual* if it's something about how to use translations in code.
1. Describe the problem exactly, in as much detail as possible. Explain what to do, step by detailed step, in order to see the issue. If you don't have much experience with reporting bugs, read [this very helpful article]( http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).
1. Don't forget to mention your Poedit version, your operating system and its version.
1. If the problem is specific to a particular PO file, attach it. Mention the specific item in it that can be used to see the issue if applicable.
1. If the problem is with extraction from source code, attach the code as well.
