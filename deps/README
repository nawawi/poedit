================

This directory contains all 3rd party dependencies needed to build Poedit.
It's typically not needed on Linux, where all the dependencies are commonly
available, but it comes handy when compiling for Windows and OS X.

Note that some sources are slightly patched, too.

Building the dependencies is fully integrated into Poeditâ€™s build system.
