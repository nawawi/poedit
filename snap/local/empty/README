This is an empty source directory to workaround a snapcraft 'feature' 
where parts using the nil plugin are implicitly considered to use `.` 
as an implicit source directory.

This avoids the entire source tree being unnecessarily copied as the 
part's source tree.

This also avoids the nil parts being considered 'changed' by snapcraft 
whenever a file in the source tree is modified, causing all depending 
parts' artifacts being cleaned by snapcraft.
