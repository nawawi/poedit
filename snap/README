================

This is the snap package definition to build a snap package of Poedit


  Using
---------

Docker doesn't work due to use of symlinks; you have to use LXD. Don't use VM
shared folders or remote mounts either; the only reliable way to build is by
doing it on native filesystem.

1. Install LXD containers per https://docs.snapcraft.io/build-snaps/build-on-lxd-docker
   (expect a few failures and repeating commands here, as well as having to manually get
   apt into a sane state so that it doesn't ignore universe).

   $ lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 snapcraft -c security.privileged=true
   $ lxc config device add snapcraft homedir disk source=$PWD path=$PWD

   $ lxc exec snapcraft -- snap install snapcraft --classic

   $ lxc exec snapcraft -- sh -c "apt update"


2. Run the build:

   $ lxc exec snapcraft -- sh -c "cd $(pwd); snapcraft"
